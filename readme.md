About Spacebrew  
===============  
Spacebrew is an open, dynamically re-routable software toolkit for choreographing interactive spaces. Or, in other words, a simple way to connect interactive things to one another. Every element you hook up to the system can subscribe to, and publish data feeds. Each data feed has a data type. There are three different data types supported by Spacebrew: boolean (true/false), number range (0-1023) or string (text). Once elements are set up, you can use a web based visual switchboard to connect or disconnect publishers and subscribers to each other.

Using Library
==============   
  
###Before you Get Started: Install Dependencies   
Before you get started you need to install the appropriate websockets library. There are many different ones out there, so make sure to get the one called `websocket-client`. [Here is a link to code repo for the `websocket-client` library](https://github.com/liris/websocket-client). The easiest way to install this library is using pip, python's package manager. If you have pip installed on your computer all you have to do is run the command below in the Terminal (or whichever other console app you prefer). Otherwise, follow the instructions on the `websocket-client` repo.  
  
```
pip install websocket-client
```
  
If you have the wrong websocket library installed you will need to uninstall it before installing websocket-client. Using pip, you can uninstall if by running the following command `pip uninstall websocket`.  
  
###1. Import python library into your project  
Import the Spacebrew class into your project using a `from ... import` command at the start of your script. Please note that if you change the name of the folder or file containing the Spacebrew class then you will need to update the sample command below accordingly.  
  
```
from spacebrewInterface.spacebrew import Spacebrew
```
   
###2. Create a Spacebrew object  
Create an instance of a Spacebrew Client object using the `Spacebrew` class constructor.  

Syntax Overview:
```
brew = Spacebrew("app name", description="app description", server="sandbox.spacebrew.cc", port=9000):
```

Example From String_Client.py App
```
brew = Spacebrew("pyString Example", server="sandbox.spacebrew.cc")
```
  
**Constructor Parameters**
The constructor accepts four parameters: `name`, `server`, `description`, and `port`. The last three of these are optional. If server is not specified then it will default to `sandbox.spacebrew.cc`, the description will default to an empty string, while the port will default to 9000.  
         
###3. Configure data subscription and publication Feeds  
The next step involves specifying the subscription and publication data feeds. Each data feed needs to be assigned a unique label and a data type. The standard data types are: `"string"`, `"range"`, of `"boolean"`. Custom data types are also supported. The name of a custom data type is arbitrary. To link custom publication and subscription data feeds the name needs to be consistent accross both.   

Syntax Overview:
```
brew.addPublisher("publish feed name", "data type")
brew.addSubscriber("subscribe feed name", "data type")
```

Example From String_Client.py App
```
brew.addPublisher("local state", "boolean")
brew.addSubscriber("remote state", "boolean")
```
  
###4. Define message event handler methods
Once you've defined the subscription data feeds you need to configure the callback methods that will handle messages received via Spacebrew. This step is crucial to enable your app to respond to Spacebrew messages


Syntax Overview:
```
def handlerMethod(value):
	# do something with the value received

brew.subscribe("subscribe feed name", handlerMethod)
```

Example From String_Client.py App  
```
def handleBoolean(value):
	global pos, code, stdscr
	stdscr.addstr(pos_remote, pos_state, (str(value) + "  ").encode(code))
	stdscr.refresh()

brew.subscribe("remote state", handleBoolean)
```
  
The current version of the python library does not offer hooks for lifecycle events such as on open, on close and on error. However, it does output messages to the terminal the confirme when the Spacebrew connection is opened and closed. This is a feature that will be added in a future update.

###6. Connect to Spacebrew
Now that you have configured the Spacebrew object it is time to connect to the Spacebrew server. 
  
```
brew.start()
```
  
###7. Publish messages  
The `publish` method enables you to publish messages via one of the publication data feeds. It accepts two mandatory parameters, a channel name and a value. The value needs to correspond to the expected data type otherwise the message will be ignored by the server.  
    
```
brew.publish("publish feed name","data")
```

###8. Close connection on exit
When building python apps it is always a best practice to close the spacebrew connection on exit. 

```
finally:
	brew.stop()
```

###Common Error Messages
The following error message means that the app was not able to connect to the Spacebrew server to which it was pointed. Make sure that the app is set-up to connect to the appropriate server.  
  
```
ERROR:root:ERROR: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known
```

Example Apps
=============

Here is a list of the core examples that are included in this repo. These examples were designed to help you get started building apps that connect to other applications, objects and spaces via Spacebrew. Please note that all of these apps run in the terminal and use python's standard curse library to handle the UI.

To run any of these scripts just navigate to the pySpacebrew folder on the Terminal (or other console app) and then run the command below. Please note that you can specify the app's name and server when launching the app by using the optional arguments `name` and `server` as shown below. 

Launch script without optional arguments:
```
python string_client.py
```

Launch script with optional arguments:
```
python string_client.py name=pyString server=sandbox.spacebrew.cc
```

###Boolean Client
App that sends out a boolean message every time the enter or return key is pressed, and displays the latest boolean value it has received. File name: boolean_client.py

###String Client
App that functions like a chat program. It can send messages up 60 char long and it displays the first 60 chars of incoming messages. File name: string_client.py

###Range Client
App that sends out a range value (0 - 1023). The value increases and decreased in response to `+` and `-` keys. App also displays a range value received from Spacebrew. File name: range_client.py
  
###Custom Client (Virtual Dice App)
App that publishes and subscribes to a custom data type called dice. It rolls a virtual dice every time the enter or return key is pressed (generates a random number between 1 and 6). It also displays the latest remote dice roll value received. File name: custom_client.py

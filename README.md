This requires use of the websocket-client library ... https://github.com/liris/websocket-client

It can be installed using 'pip install websocket-client'

Be aware that there is another python package called 'websocket' that uses the same package name. If you have websocket installed you will need to uninstall it before installing websocket-client. (You can uninstall if with 'pip uninstall websocket'.)

The other python libraries should be standard.

spacebrew.py provides a SpaceBrew object which can be used to create subscribers and publishers. See spacebrew_ex.py for a simple tutorial.



This also requires feedparser library
It can be installed using 'pip install feedparser'

This requires use of the websocket-client library ... https://github.com/liris/websocket-client

It can be installed using 'pip install websocket-client'

The other libraries should be standard. The first example simply posts a message every 5 seconds and prints incoming messages. It's as reduced as made sense to me, but could use a lot of work, particularly around parsing the incoming messages in meaningful ways.
